# Shila theme for Drupal 8 üêï

An [atomic design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) and [Pattern Lab](http://patternlab.io/) friendly, [component-based](https://github.com/aleksip/component-based-theming), fairly unopinionated starting point for new Drupal 8 themes. Shila theme can be used stand-alone with Pattern Lab, and currently supports both Pattern Lab Node and Pattern Lab PHP.

For more information and documentation, see the [project Wiki](https://github.com/aleksip/shila-drupal-theme/wiki).


## Setup

Prerequisites: [npm](https://nodejs.org/) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed.

In the Shila theme root directory run

```sh
npm run setup
```



## Gulp tasks

The theme includes a `gulpfile.js` with some useful tasks. However, using Gulp and these tasks is completely optional.

The default task compiles any Sass files, generates Pattern Lab, launches a Browsersync server at `http://localhost:3000` and then keeps watching for any changes made to Sass, Twig and other files.

For the default task, in the Shila theme root directory run

```sh
gulp
```

To list all available tasks with short descriptions, in the Shila theme root directory run

```sh
gulp --tasks
```
